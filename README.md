# Flare Framework

**Flare** is a lightweight, modular CSS and JavaScript framework designed to streamline web development projects. It helps you build responsive layouts, interactive components, and reusable UI elements efficiently. The framework uses modern technologies like **TypeScript** and **SCSS**, offering both flexibility and structure for developers.

## Features

- **Responsive Grid System**: A flexible percentage-based grid system for creating dynamic layouts across all screen sizes.
- **Utility Classes**: Includes commonly used utility classes for margins, paddings, and visibility (e.g., `d-none`, `d-block`), allowing for quick layout modifications.
- **Interactive Components**: Built-in JavaScript functionality for UI components like dropdowns, modals, accordions, and more.
- **Modular & Customizable**: Easily extend or modify components using SCSS and TypeScript for custom development.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Integrated **Cypress** for comprehensive E2E testing of your UI interactions.

## Installation

To get started with **Flare**, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChristianSeip/Flare-Framework.git
cd flare-framework
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server using:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will open a local server and watch for changes as you develop your project.

## Usage

Include the `bundle.js` and `style.css` files generated by Webpack in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/style.css">
<script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

### Example: Adding a Dropdown

Here is how you can create a dropdown using the Flare framework:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="FlareFramework.toggleDropdown(this)">Toggle Dropdown</button>
<div class="d-none">
  <p>This is a dropdown content.</p>
</div>
```

## Development

The project uses **Webpack** to bundle CSS and JavaScript. You can add or modify SCSS/TypeScript files in the `src/` directory.

### Build the Project

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the minified `bundle.js` and `style.css` files in the `dist/` directory.

## Testing

End-to-End testing is done using **Cypress**. To run the tests, start the server and Cypress together:

```bash
npm run test
```

Cypress will open a GUI to manage and run the E2E tests.
